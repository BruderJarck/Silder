bare minimum dod:
cart moves end to end, no overheat, no stalling
set time possible max 24h
no noticeable vibrations
stands on own feet
instructions

issue:
software:
	[ ] Home speed == prev. filming speed
	[ ] Imedieate start results in shaky recordings => Acc/decelleration 
	![ ] slow rotaty turn sample rate => interrupts
	[ ] weired ui
	[ ] longest interval = lowest rpm setting => move incrementally
mechanical:
	[ ] el side enclosure
	[x] loose belt axis el site
	[ ] rails too close to each other at ends
	[ ] rails too flexible in middle
	[ ] feet fixture not clear 
	[ ] !el. side endstop never touched by kart
	[ ] mot. side endstop never touched by kart
	[ ] no camera mount
	[ ] motor transferes too much vibrations to camera
	![ ] if stpper backdrives as soon there is no power anymore => problem at operating on (steep) angles => dc brushed wormgearmotor
	[ ] shitty chart
	[ ] no mouning points for tripods
elektinics:
	[x] only proto electronik 
	[x] proto electronic just with arduino uno
	[ ] electronics dosnt fit into housing
	[x] stepup gets to hot
	[x] flimsy wiring => custom pcb
	
other:
	[ ] no instructions


Feat:

software:
	set total time not only speed
	display remaining time
	go back to menue if job done
	edit setup page
	disable motor everytime its not in use
	super long slide periodes
	bluetooth module
	inceasing time incements at speed set
	only travel set distance from setpoint
meachanical:
	angle adjustment camera mount
	compability to 3/8" tripot at both ends

testing:
sysstemtest:
	minspeed
	maxspeed
	flat  angles
	steep angles
max batt circle lifetime

unit test :
	motor
	stepup module
	encoder
	dislplay
