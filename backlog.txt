bare minimum dod:
cart moves end to end, no overheat, no stalling
set time possible max 24h
no noticeable vibrations
stands on own feet
instructions

issue:
software:
	Home speed == prev. filming speed
	Imedieate start results in shaky recordings => Acc/decelleration 
	slow rotaty turn sample rate => interrupts
	weired ui
mechanical:
	el side enclosure
	!loose belt axis el site
	rails too close to each other at ends
	rails too flexible in middle
	feet fixture not clear 
	!el. side endstop never touched by kart
	mot. side endstop never touched by kart
	no camera mount
	motor transferes too much vibrations to camera
elektinics:
	!only proto electronik 
	!proto electronic just with arduino uno
	!just proto electonics
other:
	no instructions


Feat:

software:
	set total time not only speed
	display remaining time
	go back to menue if job done
	edit setup page
	disable motor everytime its not in use
	super long slide periodes
	bluetooth module
	inceasing time incements at speed set
	only travel set distance from setpoint
meachanical:
	angle adjustment camera mount
	compability to 3/8" tripot at both ends

testing:
sysstemtest:
	minspeed
	maxspeed
	flat  angles
	steep angles
max batt circle lifetime

unit test :
	motor
	stepup module
	encoder
	dislplay
